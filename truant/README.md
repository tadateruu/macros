# Truant Macros
Miscellaneous macros I use on my New Nintendo 2DSXL running custom firmware. Only one currently is a shiny hunting script that does automatic resets for a shiny starter in Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire--more are to come.

## Requirements
- Hacked 3DS with InputRedirection support
- pynput
- [tppflush](https://github.com/hlixed/TPPFLUSH)

## To-do
- Detect shiny event (apparently the bottom screen has a delay when a shiny is about to be encountered)
- Somehow optimize my code (possibly rewrite in nim)
- Stop playing Pokemon and get a job
