# macros
My private collection of various macros ranging from shiny hunting on Pokemon ORAS using TPPFLUSH and InputRedirection to automatically rotating MAC addresses to obtain free WiFi from Cox WiFi hotspots.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach me on Matrix. The entirety of this repo is under WTFPL, so do whatever you'd like with this.
